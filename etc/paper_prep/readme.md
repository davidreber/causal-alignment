The place where rough thoughts are gathered, before really being synthesized into a paper.

The pipeline is as follows:
- Very rough brainstorming occurs in the research_corral document (often just as bullet points)
- As I need more style (e.g. actual Latex equations, etc) I put together a less-rough version in dressing_room
- By the time the content is starting to coelesce, I transfer it to an actual document in doc/ 
- When the cycle starts over, I transfer the old content into archive/
- if I haven't needed to look at the content in archive in a while, I delete it.

I have found that this iterative process has helped me significantly reduce perfectionism, by clearly seperating the spaces of creation and editing.
